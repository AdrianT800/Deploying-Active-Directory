</p>
<p>
Once logged in, open Acfive Directory Users and Computers (ADUC) from the Windows Administrafive Tools. In the domain tree, right-click your domain (e.g., mydomain.com) and create two new Organizafional Units (OUs) named _EMPLOYEES and _ADMINS. Refresh the domain view to confirm their creafion.

</p>
<p>
Within the _ADMINS OU, create a new user named Jane Doe. Right-click inside the OU, select New > User, and enter the following: Full Name: Jane Doe, Username: jane_admin, Password: Vmdemo12345$. Check the box for Password never expires, then click Next and Finish. Log out of DC-1 and log back in using the new domain admin account: Username: mydomain.com\jane_admin, Password: Vmdemo12345$. From this point forward, use this account for all administrative tasks.
</p>
<br />


Step 3: Joining Client-1 to the Domain
<p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DJmEXEB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Disk Sanitization Steps"/>
</p>
<p>
Log into Client-1 using the local admin credentials (Username: labdemo, Password: Vmdemo12345$). Open System Settings, then click Rename this PC (Advanced) under Related Settings. In the dialog box, click Change, select Domain, and enter mydomain.com. When prompted, provide the domain credentials for Jane Doe. After successful authentication, the system will prompt for a restart. Once restarted, log in using the domain credentials.

</p>
<p>
To verify the domain join, return to DC-1, open ADUC, and expand the domain tree. Click on Computers and confirm that Client-1 appears in the list. Next, create a new OU named _CLIENTS by right-clicking the domain, selecting New > Organizational Unit, and naming it accordingly. Drag Client-1 into the _CLIENTS OU and refresh the view.
